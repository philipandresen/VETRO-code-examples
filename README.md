# VETRO-code-examples
Some basic react (and possibly node, we'll see) code examples. Written in notepad so probably not super well linted.

## REACT:
These code examples come with the acknowledgement that all teams have their own preferences for documentation, style,
naming conventions, and structure / design. I have developed my personal style of react composition through a number
of project iterations, learning from confusing and difficult to decypher component heierarchies. While the patterns
within are nuanced and debatable, they represent one example of the code I output on a daily basis, and that most
clearly conveys its purpose to the members of my current team.

## Node.JS
Coming soon!
